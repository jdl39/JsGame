TODO:
1. I need to fix the intention bug: Creeps without intention can block off access to a source but won't harvest from it; they should instead get harvest priority.
2. Add claimer/Spawn builder role.

NOTE:
1. We may encounter a bug with wandering creeps if pathing needs to go through adjascent rooms. Set maxRooms in moveTo to prevent wandering creeps.
2. So far we are good on CPU. If we need to in the future, look into caching operations.

Rewrite pass 1:
utils
	constants.js
	Utils.js
	utils.constructionSiteFinder.js
	Memphis.js
	screepsExtentions.js
structures
	StructureRole.js
	SpawnRole.js
	TowerRole.js
	UnknownStructureRole.js
creeps
	CreepRole.js
	HarvesterRole.js
	UnknownCreepRole.js
	MilitiaRole.js
	BuilderRole.js

Still need rewrite:
creeps
	extentions.creep.js
	/* ColonistRole.js */
	role.colonistTrader.js
	role.colonistWorker.js
	role.upgrader.js
