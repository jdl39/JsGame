TODO:
1. I need to fix the intention bug: Creeps without intention can block off access to a source but won't harvest from it; they should instead get harvest priority.
2. Add claimer/Spawn builder role.

NOTE:
We may encounter a bug with wandering creeps if pathing needs to go through adjascent rooms. Set maxRooms in moveTo to prevent wandering creeps.
